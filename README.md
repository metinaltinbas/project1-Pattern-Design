# CS342 Design Patterns
## Fall 2018
### PROJECT 1 README FILE

## DESIGN OVERVIEW:
- I used inheritance(Star and Planet Subclasses) and compositon(for relationship between Star and Planet)
- I created Universe with given number of stars and in every step of star creation i created random type and number of planet for the stars.
- I gave a random coordinate for probe as a starting point and sorted the stars distant to probe . After every star landing (also set star as visited), i sorted probe distance to other stars and land to closest one until I find a planet with life.

## Description


For our first assignment we are going to simulate the universe, and then search it for intelligent life. There will be two parts to this project. In Part A you will build a universe of stars and planets. Each star will have a type, an x, y, and z coordinate, and a random range of planets orbiting the star.


## Part 1

### Part A - The Stars

You should first create a Universe class as a container class for all your stars, with a method to generate your universe. The stars should derive from a base star class, and fall into one of 3 categories. Each Star type will have attributes that will affect its likelihood of intelligent life:

* DwarfStar
   * Chances of life: 0.0006
   * Range of planets: 8-15
   * Goldilocks Zone: 30-90
   * Recharge: 2**20
* GiantStar
   * Chances of life: 0.0005
   * Range of planets: 5-10
   * Goldilocks Zone: 100-250
   * Recharge: 2**30
* MediumStar
   * Chances of life: 0.0009
   * Range of planets: 2-9
   * Goldilocks Zone: 60-140
   * Recharge: 2**25

:bulb: The values above should be hard-coded into your program and adjusted
to suit your design if necessary.

Each star will have an x,y,z coordinate to give it a location in space. No two stars should have the same x, y, z coordinates. You will need to use these coordinates to navigate from star to star, so the coordinates must be readable but should not be writable, using python private variable conventions. You should randomly generate these x,y,z coordinates, each in the range of (2^3..2^64)-1.  

Each star should also have a recharge amount to be used by the probe to refuel. A larger star should have a higher recharge amount. For example, I use 2^20, 2^25, 2^30 for the Dwarf, Medium, and Giant Stars respectively. You can adjust these numbers to suit your program, but it must be *possible* to run out of fuel.

Lastly, each star will randomly generate a list of planets (more information on planets below). It should have num planets, where num is in the range of planets given above (inclusive). When you generate the planets, you will need to also randomly assign the planet’s distance from the star in millions of miles. Multiple planets can have the same distance from a star.

### Part B - Planets


Each star will have multiple planets, each with 3 different types:

* RockyPlanet
* GaseousPlanet
* HabitablePlanet

You should randomly assign planet types as they are created, and each Planet should derive from a base Planet class. The Planet base class should contain the planet’s distance from the star in millions of miles.

For example, One star, which is a Giant, may have 6 planets, 2 Rocky, 3 Gaseous, and 1 Habitable. Another Giant Star might have 8 planets, all of which are Gaseous.

Each planet should also have a unique id, preceded by a letter identifying what kind of planet it is, ‘r’ for Rocky, ‘g’ for Gaseous, and ‘h’ for Habitable.


### Part C - Life

We will be using the Star’s chances of life instance variable to mark if a planet has intelligent life. Even if the planet is marked as possible for intelligent life, it then must be within the so-called goldilocks zone for its star and must be a HabitablePlanet type.

If all of these conditions are met, you should mark the planet as having intelligent life. Otherwise, mark it as without life.

Once you have your universe set up, you should add a method to your Universe class that prints the number of stars of each type and how many planets of each type correspond to each star. (See below for sample output)

## Part 2 - The Search

### Part A - Searching for Life
Once you have generated your universe with stars, planets, and (possibly) life, it’s time to search for life. To do so you will need a ‘probe’ object that will search star to star, using an algorithm of your choosing to select which star to go to next. In this README you must explain your search algorithm, and defend why you chose it.


As you visit each star you will use fuel. Your probe will have an initial fuel amount, and can recharge at each star. The recharge amount depends on the type of star you are visiting. After recharging, your probe will check the Star’s planets, and should mark that star as visited so you don’t revisit already explored stars.  Your search ends when your probe finds a planet with intelligent life. In order for your probe to deliver the information, it must have enough fuel to return to its starting point, which means you have to keep track of the probe’s starting coordinates.

You will need to keep track of some data as you explore your simulated universe.

* The probe's starting coordinates
* How many Stars you have visited
* How many Planets you have explored
* The total distance you have traveled before finding intelligent life
   * You can use the [3 dimensional distance formula](https://www.varsitytutors.com/hotmath/hotmath_help/topics/distance-formula-in-3d) to determine the distance between stars.  

When you finally find life and successfully return to the origin, the probe should print the above information and the unique ID of the planet that contained life.

If no life was found or the probe runs out of fuel, print the above information and a message noting this.

### Part B - Requirements

The following are the basic requirements for your program:

#### Universe Class Requirements:

* The initialize method takes the number of stars to create
    * For testing, you should start out with around 2**10 or less. After you get it working, see how large you can go and still run within a reasonable amount of time.
* Should contain a print universe method that prints:
    * The number of stars in the universe
    * The number of each type of star
    * The number of each type of planet around each type of star
        * See below for example

#### Star Class Requirements:

* Star Base Class with unique x, y, z coordinates in the range 2**3..2**64
* Star SubClasses: DwarfStar, GiantStar, MediumStar
* Each Star subtype has attributes:
    * chances of life
    * number of planets (as a range)
    * goldilocks zone
    * Stars should generate and save a list of planets using the above attributes

#### Planet Class Requirements:

* Planet base class that contains distance from star ranging from 1-300 (in 10 millions of miles)
* Planet SubClasses: RockyPlanet, GaseousPlanet, HabitablePlanet
* Each Planet is marked with having or not having intelligent life
* Each planet should have a unique identifier.
    * implementation is up to you as long as it is guaranteed to be unique and is prefixed with the appropriate letter (i.e. ‘r’, ‘g’, ‘h’)

###Probe Class Requirements:

* Keeps track of the following information
    * starting coordinates
    * id of planet discovered to have intelligent life
    * total distance traveled
    * number of stars visited
    * number of planets explored
* An algorithm to determine which Star you should visit next
* A print method that prints the probe’s findings.


### Additional Requirements

* You must use composition for all HAS-A relationships.
    * For example, the planet class should not inherit from the Star class. You must have a compositional relationship between the Star and the Planet.         
* Each base class must go into a separate file. Subclasses *may* go in the same file as their base class.
* The main driver code should also be in a separate file.
* You should not have any global variables

### Git

An additional git requirement for this project is that you commit your changes throughout the development of your project. You do not necessarily need to push the commits to Github, but we will look at your repository commit history to ensure you have **3 significant commits 24 hours apart**. If you do not meet the commit requirements, we will not accept your project and you will receive a 0.

These are a reminder of the git commands you will need to submit your project.

:warning: *These commands all presume that your current working directory is within the directory tracked by `git`.*

```shell
git status
git add info.txt
git commit -a -m "final commit message"
git push
```
:warning: *You* __must__ *add any new files you create to the repository with the `git add` command or they will not upload to the repo, and your code will not work.*

To find your most recent commit hash, use the following command:

```shell
git rev-parse HEAD
```    



To complete your submission, you must copy and paste this number into mycourses. Go to MyCourses, select cs342, and **Assignment Hash Submission**. Select Project 1, and where it says text submission, paste your commit hash. The TAs will only grade your submission that corresponds to the hash you submitted. You can update this as often as you like until the deadline.

I strongly recommend making a submission early on, even if your assignment is not 100% working, to avoid late penalties. You can resubmit as many times as you like.

:warning: You __MUST__ submit the commit hash on mycourses before the deadline to be considered on time **even if your project is completely working before the deadline**. :warning:
